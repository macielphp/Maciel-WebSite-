- My professional goal
    is to share the progress of my skills.
    
- Websiteâ€™s purpose:
    The final purpose of the website is to serve users who want to create a new project and/or view their project, which includes tasks with checkboxes, start and end dates, and the responsible party for the task.
    The initial purpose of the website is simply to be a web page where, in the first section, we will have the project title (h1); a short, repetitive video without audio in the background, intended to provide a subtle sense of movement. In the second section (<section), there will be two options, subheadings (h2); the first option is "Create a Project," which will be an image with text and a clickable link (<a>); these serve as visual placeholders for features and have hyperlinks with no destination, clicking on them only reveals a message saying "Features under development." The second option will be "My Project," which will only change the text, image, and location on the page. In the third section (<section), there will be a subheading (<h2); below, there will be small images with descriptions, each. In the footer (<footer), there will be icons with links to access the means of contacting the website creator (LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, email).
