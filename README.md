- My professional goal
    is to share the progress of my skills.
    
- Websiteâ€™s purpose:
    The final purpose of the website is to serve users who want to create a new project and/or view their project, which includes tasks with checkboxes, start and end dates, and the responsible party for the task.
    The initial purpose of the website is simply to be a web page where, in the first section, we will have the project title (h1); a short, repetitive video without audio in the background, intended to provide a subtle sense of movement. In the second section (<section), there will be two options, subheadings (h2); the first option is "Create a Project," which will be an image with text and a clickable link (<a>); these serve as visual placeholders for features and have hyperlinks with no destination, clicking on them only reveals a message saying "Features under development." The second option will be "My Project," which will only change the text, image, and location on the page. In the third section (<section), there will be a subheading (<h2); below, there will be small images with descriptions, each. In the footer (<footer), there will be icons with links to access the means of contacting the website creator (LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, email).

    1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you don't already have Visual Studio Code installed, download and install it from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    2. **Create a Folder for Your Project**: Create a folder in your file system where you want to store your project.
    3. **Create an HTML File**: Within the project folder, create an HTML file with an appropriate name, for example, "index.html." You can do this in Visual Studio Code by right-clicking the folder and choosing "New File," then rename it to "index.html."
    4. **Write HTML Code**: Open the "index.html" file in Visual Studio Code and start writing the HTML code according to the requirements you described. You'll need to include HTML tags, titles, images, hyperlinks, etc., according to the structure you outlined.
    5. **Create a CSS File**: Within the same folder, create a CSS file with an appropriate name, for example, "styles.css." You can do this in Visual Studio Code the same way you created the HTML file.
    6. **Write CSS Code**: Open the "styles.css" file in Visual Studio Code and start writing CSS code to style your website. Define colors, fonts, sizes, and other styles according to your desired design.
    7. **Link the CSS File to HTML**: In your HTML file, within the **`<head>`** section, add a link to your CSS file. For example:
    8. **Preview the Website**: Open the "index.html" file in Visual Studio Code and right-click in the code. Select "Open with Live Server" to preview the website in your browser.
    9. **GitHub**: If you want to host your project on GitHub, create a repository on GitHub and follow the instructions provided by GitHub to upload your code. Make sure to make the repository private if you want it to be accessible only by you.
